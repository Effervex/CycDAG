CycDAG
======

A lightweight reimplementation of the OpenCyc ontology system. This project aims to replicate most of OpenCyc's functionality and data while remaining reasonably simple to use, efficient, and with low-memory usage. This need came about to address issues with OpenCyc's stability, accessibility, memory usage, and perhaps speed (though it is not yet known if CycDAG is faster).
